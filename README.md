### Who am I?
Hello there! My name is Julian (he/him). I'm a Computer Science and Computational Mathematics student at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I'm fascinated by mathematics, data science, and machine learning. 

Currently, I'm interning at a biomedical startup called **Blackthorn Therapeutics**, where I'm using engineering data pipelines and ML models to help predict what makes a person prone to anxiety.
